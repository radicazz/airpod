Run `airpods --help` for all available commands and options.

## Get Started

### Requirements

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): Install, upgrade & manage `airpods`
- Container Runtime (one of the following):
  - `podman` + `podman-compose` (recommended)
  - `docker` + `docker-compose`

> [!NOTE]
> AirPods automatically detects which container runtime is available. If both are installed, Podman is preferred by default. You can explicitly choose a runtime by setting `runtime.prefer` in your config file.

### Installation

Install `airpods` with `uv`:

```bash
# This is the nighly installation.
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/radicazz/airpods.git@main"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Upgrade your installation with `uv tool upgrade airpods` when a new version is available.
