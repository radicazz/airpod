# docs

- Keep docs short, non-bloated, and task-focused.
- All docs must be Markdown (`.md`) files.
- The top-level heading of each file should be its docs path (for example, `docs/goals`, `docs/commands/config`).
- Prefer clear, user-friendly language over internal jargon.
- Avoid repeating content from `README.md`; link or summarize instead.
- When adding new files, group them under logical subdirectories like `docs/commands` or `docs/concepts`.
